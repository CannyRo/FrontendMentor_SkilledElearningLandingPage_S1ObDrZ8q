## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned, or rather I put my patience to the test, an indispensable quality to be combined with perseverance in order to achieve this challenge. As with other challenges, I don't necessarily find the right solution the first time. So I had to do, undo and redo in order to achieve this result, which remains obviously be improved.

### Continued development

The management of Html elements Picture, Source, Img, etc... in order to have a dynamic management of images directly in Html.

### Useful resources
